          <p> Hi, my name is Maddie I was previously enrolled at Trent University for the forensic science program. After two years in that program I realized it wasn't the program for me, I needed something with more creative freedom. I decided to switch to Algonquin College for the interactive media design (IMD) program. This program has allowed me to have the creative freedom I desired and the careers in this field are more suitable to the lifestyle I want to live.  </p>
          <p> This is my second paragraph </p>
